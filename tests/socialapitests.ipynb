I have a couple of doubts, and I’d really appreciate your insights:\\n\\nDoubt 1:\\n\\nDo traders usually create a separate account for trading apart from their investment account, where they hold long-term positions? I’m asking because I’m curious about how short selling works when you already own the asset.\\n\\nFor example, let’s say I have XRP in my investment account, and I enter a short position on XRP/USDT. Instead of borrowing XRP for the short position, would the platform automatically sell the XRP I already own? Or does it work differently? I want to understand if separating trading and investment accounts is a common practice for this reason.\\n\\nDoubt 2:\\n\\nI understand that for day traders (whether scalping or trading within a few hours), entering and exiting positions happens within the same day, so short selling seems straightforward.\\n\\nHowever, for swing traders — who hold positions open for several days or even weeks — how does short selling work? Since short positions involve borrowing assets, does holding a short position for multiple days come with any fees or special considerations? Is short selling in swing trading a common strategy, or are there limitations to be aware of?\\n\\nI want to make sure I grasp both the practical and technical aspects of how this works.\\n\\nLooking forward to learning from your experiences. Thanks in advance!\", 'Top Comments On Post: ', \"Comment 1: For the first doubt, many traders do keep separate accounts or at least distinct portions within their account for long-term investing versus active trading. In many brokerages, you need a margin account to engage in short selling, which is different from a standard cash account. If you already hold XRP in your investment account and want to short XRP/USDT, the broker will not automatically use your XRP holdings to cover the short position. Instead, the short sale is executed using borrowed XRP from the broker's lending pool or other clients. Some brokers allow you to transfer assets between accounts, but generally, keeping a dedicated trading or margin account helps avoid confusion and ensures you have the proper setup for borrowing and short selling.\\n\\nFor the second doubt, short selling for swing trading typically involves additional costs because you are borrowing an asset over multiple days. Brokers charge interest or borrowing fees for holding a short position, and these fees can add up over time, especially if the stock or crypto is hard to borrow. There may also be dividend payments to cover if the shorted asset pays dividends. Swing traders need to factor these costs into their strategy.\\n\\n– LHM - Founder at [Sferica Trading](https://sfericatrading.com/home): Simplifying algorithmic trading with tested strategies and seamless automation.\", 'Post Title: Stock Lending\\nPost Text: Who owns shares in a stock that is hard to borrow and allows their broker to lend them out but has never received anything indicating that they were actually lent out?

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Trading) if you have any questions or concerns.*\", 'Comment 2: When you own shares in an account, you remain the legal owner even if your broker lends them out. Most brokers include language in their agreements that gives them the right to lend out fully paid or margin shares, especially if the stock is hard to borrow. In many cases, if your shares are lent out, you might not receive a notification unless you’re enrolled in a securities lending program that provides compensation. Typically, if you do participate, you may receive a portion of the lending fee, while the broker keeps the remainder. The exact split depends on your broker’s policies and any agreements you’ve signed.\\n\\nIt’s common for brokers to lend out shares in order to facilitate short selling and other market activities, and they are required to follow regulatory guidelines about how lending fees are distributed.\\n\\n– LHM - Founder at [Sferica Trading](https://sfericatrading.com/home): Simplifying algorithmic trading with tested strategies and seamless automation.']\n"
