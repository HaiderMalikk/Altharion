Reddit Data Analysis Script

This script performs sentiment analysis on Reddit posts and comments to analyze stock mentions and their sentiments.
It uses the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) to fetch data from Reddit and the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool to analyze the sentiment of the text.

Steps to get to the final output:

1. **API Client Initialization**:
    - Initialize the OpenAI client using the OpenAI API key.
    - Authenticate with the Reddit API using the credentials and create a Reddit client.

2. **Fetch Reddit Posts**:
    - Define a function `get_reddit_posts` to fetch posts and comments from a specified subreddit.
    - The function retrieves the titles, selftexts, and comments of the fetched posts.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
    - Initialize the VADER sentiment analyzer.
    - Define a function `analyze_sentiment` to analyze the sentiment of a given text.
    - The function returns a sentiment score ranging from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive).

4. **Normalize Sentiment Scores**:
    - Define a function `normalize_score` to boost sentiment scores to improve ranking impact.
    - The function amplifies positive and negative scores.

5. **Extract Stock Mentions**:
    - Define a function `extract_stock_mentions` to extract stock tickers (e.g., $TSLA, $AAPL) from the posts and track their sentiment.
    - The function uses regular expressions to find stock tickers and calculates the average sentiment for each stock.

6. **get reddit analysis**:
    - Define a function `classify_stocks` to classify stocks mentioned in a subreddit's posts based on sentiment analysis.
    - The function returns a dictionary containing lists of stocks classified into three categories:
        - "top_stocks": The top 5 stocks with the highest sentiment scores.
        - "worst_stocks": The bottom 5 stocks with the lowest sentiment scores.
        - "rising_stocks": Stocks with sentiment scores above 0.5, indicating positive sentiment.

7. **Specific Stock Analysis**:
    - Define a function `specific_stock_analysis` to return sentiment and mentions for a specific stock.
    - The function retrieves posts from a subreddit, extracts stock mentions, and returns a formatted string containing the stock's sentiment and mention counts.

8. **General Reddit Analysis**:
    - Define a function `general_reddit_analysis` to perform general stock analysis for a subreddit.
    - The function analyzes the subreddit and returns the results.

Usage:
    - Run the script to authenticate with Reddit and OpenAI, fetch Reddit posts, perform sentiment analysis, and classify stocks based on sentiment.
    - The script prints out the general stock analysis for the specified subreddit and the specific stock analysis for the specified stock.

Example:
    - To analyze the sentiment of stocks mentioned in the "wallstreetbets" subreddit and get the analysis for the stock "TSLA":
        ```
        subreddit = "wallstreetbets"
        stock = "TSLA"
        limit = 20
        general_analysis = general_reddit_analysis(subreddit, limit)
        specific_analysis = specific_stock_analysis(subreddit, stock, limit)
        print(general_analysis)
        print(specific_analysis)
        ```
NOTE: only one subbreddit can be analyzed at a time, while you can input a whole array of subreddits
in the main function each subreddit will be analyzed one at a time on multiple threads.
this is more efficient than analyzing all subreddits at once, its possible beacuse each subreddit is independent of the other.
